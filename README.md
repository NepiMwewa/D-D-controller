# D-D-controller
This project is using JavaScript Prototype to create player objects to store information and functions in a character that can be dynamically changed in time. The commands are hardcoded in the JavaScript. To read the output, read the console logs on the index.html.
Created this project as the final assignment for my DMA C211 "Web scripting with JavaScript" class. The assignment was to demonstrate knowledge of prototype objects in JavaScript, I decided to turn it into a D&D Player Controller as it could be used to quickly keep track of player characters and NPCs.
